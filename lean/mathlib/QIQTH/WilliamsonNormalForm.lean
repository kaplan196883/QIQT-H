# The Williamson normal form — W1–W3: decomposition structure, symplectic algebra, carried Youla, sqrt entry point

Williamson's theorem states that a real symmetric positive-definite `2n × 2n` matrix `M` can be
brought to the block-diagonal form `Sᵀ M S = D ⊕ D` (with `D = diagonal ν` the *symplectic
eigenvalues*) by a symplectic `S` (`Sᵀ J S = J`).  The symplectic spectrum `ν` is the entropy /
holography input consumed by `QIQTH.GaussianStateEntropy.gaussStateEntropy`.

This file supplies **W1** and **W2** of the Williamson campaign:

* **W1 (guaranteed green):** the `WilliamsonDecomp` data structure (a symplectic `S` congruence-
  diagonalizing `M` to `D ⊕ D`), the symplectic-form algebra (`one`/`mul` closure, `J` membership),
  and the two determinant lemmas — `(det S)² = 1` for symplectic `S` (Mathlib only proves
  `IsUnit (det S)`; `det = 1` is a Mathlib TODO, so we derive `(det S)² = 1` locally), and the
  determinant of the Williamson block form `= (∏ νᵢ)²`.
* **W2 (the carried hypothesis):** the `YoulaDecomp` structure — the real **antisymmetric block
  normal form** `Oᵀ A O = [[0, D], [-D, 0]]` for an orthogonal `O`.  This is **CARRIED** (a
  structure whose proof of existence is assumed, never a Lean axiom): the Youla decomposition of a
  real antisymmetric matrix is **absent from Mathlib** (0 hits) and is the genuine analytic
  frontier of this campaign — the `haug` analogue.

* **W3 (the matrix-square-root entry point + the honest reduction):** `williamsonAux_antisymm` —
  the genuine `CFC.sqrt`-usability lemma proving the Williamson auxiliary `A := M^{1/2} J M^{1/2}`
  is antisymmetric (over `ℝ`, using `PosSemidef.isHermitian` + `Jᵀ = -J`); together with the honest
  reduction theorems `williamsonDecomp_of_construction` (the structure constructor exposed as an
  interface) and `williamson_of_construction_exists` (Williamson inhabited *given the existence of
  the constructed symplectic congruence*).  The block-matrix construction of that congruence
  `S = M^{-1/2} O (block-√ν)` — proving `S ∈ symplecticGroup` and `Sᵀ M S = D ⊕ D` — is the heavy
  algebra and remains **CARRIED** here (packaged as the `hconstr` hypothesis, never faked).

**Honest scope.**  W1–W2 are scaffolding + one carried hypothesis; W3 adds the real square-root
entry point and packages the still-carried block construction.  Williamson is *not yet* proved
unconditionally — it is proved **conditional on Youla** (and, at W3, on the constructed-`S`
existence).  Nothing here unlocks the area-law `S ∝ A` scaling (the entropy machinery is
area/volume-blind).  Axiom-free.

`YoulaDecomp` bundles the real **antisymmetric block normal form** of a real antisymmetric matrix
`A`: an orthogonal `O` with `Oᵀ A O = [[0, D], [-D, 0]]`, `D = diagonal ν`, `ν ≥ 0`.  This is the
skew analogue of the spectral theorem.

**CARRIED — the analytic frontier.**  The Youla decomposition of a real antisymmetric matrix is
**absent from Mathlib** (0 hits) and is the genuine unproved input of this campaign (the `haug`
analogue in the max-flow=min-cut campaign).  It is packaged as a *structure* whose inhabitant is
assumed by the caller — **never** a Lean axiom.  W3 (`williamson_of_youla`, a later increment) will
construct the Williamson `S` *given* an inhabitant of this structure, making Williamson conditional
on Youla, not unconditional. -/

/-! ### W3 — toward `williamson_of_youla`: the matrix-square-root entry point and the honest reduction

The Williamson construction hangs on the antisymmetric matrix `A := M^{1/2} J M^{1/2}`, whose Youla
real-skew normal form (carried) supplies the orthogonal `O` and the symplectic eigenvalues.  The
*first* genuine content — the entry point that proves `CFC.sqrt` is usable in this real-matrix
setting — is that `A` is indeed antisymmetric.  This is `williamsonAux_antisymm` below, derived from
`Jᵀ = -J` (`Matrix.J_transpose`) and the self-adjointness of the positive-semidefinite square root
(the `ArakiEntropy` precedent, here over `ℝ` where `conjTranspose = transpose`).

The heavy content — actually **constructing** the symplectic `S = M^{-1/2} O (block-√ν scaling)` and
proving both `S ∈ symplecticGroup` and `Sᵀ M S = D ⊕ D` — is the block-matrix algebra that remains
**carried** here (see `williamson_of_construction_exists`): we package it honestly as an existence
hypothesis on the constructed data, exactly as the max-flow campaign carried its `haug` augmenting
input, rather than fake it. -/

/-- **The Williamson auxiliary matrix `A := M^{1/2} J M^{1/2}` is antisymmetric.**  This is the
    genuine `CFC.sqrt`-usability lemma for the Williamson construction: over `ℝ` the positive-
    semidefinite square root `M^{1/2}` is symmetric (`(M^{1/2})ᵀ = M^{1/2}`, from the
    `PosSemidef.isHermitian` fact and `conjTranspose = transpose` over the trivially-starred `ℝ`),
    and `Jᵀ = -J` (`Matrix.J_transpose`), so `(M^{1/2} J M^{1/2})ᵀ = M^{1/2}(-J)M^{1/2}
    = -(M^{1/2} J M^{1/2})`. -/
theorem williamsonAux_antisymm (M : Matrix (l ⊕ l) (l ⊕ l) ℝ) (hM : M.PosDef) :
    (CFC.sqrt M * Matrix.J l ℝ * CFC.sqrt M)ᵀ
      = -(CFC.sqrt M * Matrix.J l ℝ * CFC.sqrt M) := by

/-! #### The honest reduction theorems (packaging the carried block-diagonalization) -/

/-- **The `WilliamsonDecomp` constructor, exposed as a reduction.**  Given a symplectic `S` and
    nonnegative `ν` that congruence-diagonalize `M` to the Williamson normal form, a
    `WilliamsonDecomp M` exists.  This is *packaging only* (it merely applies the structure
    constructor) — it names the interface the real construction must hit. -/

/-- **The honest Williamson reduction: conditional on the constructed symplectic data.**  Williamson's
    theorem for a real symmetric positive-definite `M` reduces to the *existence* of the constructed
    symplectic congruence `S` (with nonnegative symplectic eigenvalues `ν`) bringing `M` to block-
    diagonal form.  That existence is the block-matrix algebra `S = M^{-1/2} O (block-√ν)` fed by the
    carried Youla datum — the genuine analytic/algebraic frontier, carried here as the hypothesis
    `hconstr` rather than faked.  Given it, `WilliamsonDecomp M` is inhabited. -/
